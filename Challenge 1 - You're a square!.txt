=================================DESCRIPTION=================================
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
isSquare(-1) returns  false
isSquare(0) returns   true
isSquare(3) returns   false
isSquare(4) returns   true
isSquare(25) returns  true  
isSquare(26) returns  false
=================================MY SOLUTION=================================
var isSquare = function(n){
  var squaredNum = Math.sqrt(n); //square the given number
  
  if (Number.isInteger(squaredNum) == false) { //if the squared number is not a whole number
    return false; //it is not a perfect square
  }
  else { //if it is a whole number
  return true; //it is a perfect square
  }
}
